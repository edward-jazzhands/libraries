# Libraries By Edward Jazzhands

Welcome to my library hub!  

I build Python libraries focused on being easy to use, well-documented, and production-ready. I also manage the [Textual Tool Yard](https://github.com/ttygroup) organization, a loose affiliation of some prominent Textual library developers.
